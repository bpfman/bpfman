The v0.5.1 release is a patch release that introduced a bytecode image spec update to support multiple images
and adds build tooling for bytecode images.
It also makes some changes so that the main branch uses the "latest" versions of the XDP and TC dispatchers,
and released versions use the version supported by the release.

## Known Issues
* Release v0.5.1 and earlier do not work due to a change in the Cosign API
  ([Issue 1241](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/issues/1241)).  In follow-on
  releases, whether to use Cosign was made configurable, but for release v0.5.1
  and earlier, there is no workaround other than to use a later release.
