## Versioning strategy

### Overview

Each new release of bpfman is defined with a "bundle version" that
represents the Git tag of a release, such as `v0.4.2`. This contains the
components described above

#### Kubernetes API Versions (e.g. v1alpha2, v1beta1)

Within the bpfman-operator, API versions are primarily used to indicate the stability of
a resource. For example, if a resource has not yet graduated to beta, it is
still possible that it could either be removed from the API or changed in
backwards incompatible ways. For more information on API versions, refer to the
[full Kubernetes API versioning
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning).

## Releasing a new version

### Writing a Changelog

To simplify release notes generation, we recommend using the [Kubernetes release
notes generator](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/cmd/release-notes):

```bash
go install k8s.io/release/cmd/release-notes@latest
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
release-notes --start-sha EXAMPLE_COMMIT --end-sha EXAMPLE_COMMIT --branch main --repo bpfman --org bpfman
```

This output will likely need to be reorganized and cleaned up a bit, but it
provides a good starting point. Once you're satisfied with the changelog, create
a PR. This must go through the regular PR review process and get merged into the
`main` branch. Approval of the PR indicates community consensus for a new
release.

Additionally you can navigate to the github release page and draft a release
generating release notes there as well.

### Release Steps

The following steps must be done by one of the [bpfman maintainers][bpfman-team],
please always try and cut a release candidate before pushing an official major
or minor release.

#### RELEASE CANDIDATE Release

Often times cutting a release candidate is a great way to test any changes to
our release infrastructure before cutting an official release. Make sure release
candidate versions contain an `rc` suffix i.e `0.4.0-rc1`.  This is a lighter
weight process meaning many of the versioned manifests do not necessarily need
to be created.

- Open an update PR that:
    - Adds a new changelog for the release
    - Updates the [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/blob/main/Cargo.toml) version for the workspace:
        - `version = "x.x.x"`
        - `bpfman = { version = "x.x.x", path = "./bpfman" }"`
        - `bpfman-api = { version = "x.x.x", path = "./bpfman-api" }`
        - Note: `bpfman-csi` does not need to be updated.
    - Runs `cargo generate-lockfile`
    - Updates the bpfman-operator version in it's [Makefile](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman-operator/blob/main/Makefile):
        - `VERSION ?= x.x.x`
- Make sure CI is green and merge the update PR.
- Create a tag using the `HEAD` of the `main` branch. This can be done using the `git` CLI or
  Github's [release][release] page.
- Tag the release using the commit on `main` where the changelog update merged.
  This can  be done using the `git` CLI or Github's [release][release]
  page.

Once these steps are completed:

- Make sure a new RPM has been built and pushed to the bpfman COPR repository.
- Make sure all [actions][gh-actions] have completed successfully
- Ensure images are built and updated with the new version tag at:
    - quay.io/bpfman
    - quay.io/bpfman-bytecode
    - quay.io/bpfman-userspace

#### PATCH Release

- Create a new branch in your fork named something like `<githubuser>/release-x.x.x`. Use the new branch
  in the upcoming steps.
- Use `git` to cherry-pick all relevant PRs into your branch.
- Create a branch from the major-minor tag of interest i.e:
  `git checkout -b release-x.x.x <major.minor.patch>`
- Create a pull request of the `<githubuser>/release-x.x.x` branch into the `release-x.x` branch upstream.
  Add a hold on this PR waiting for at least one maintainer/codeowner to provide a `lgtm`. This PR:
    - Adds a new changelog for the release
    - Updates the [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/blob/main/Cargo.toml) version for the workspace:
        - `version = "x.x.x"`
        - `bpfman = { version = "x.x.x", path = "./bpfman" }"`
        - `bpfman-api = { version = "x.x.x", path = "./bpfman-api" }`
        - Note: `bpfman-csi` does not need to be updated.
    - Runs `cargo generate-lockfile`
    - Updates the bpfman-operator version in it's [Makefile](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman-operator/blob/main/Makefile):
        - `VERSION ?= x.x.x`
    - Runs `make bundle` from the bpfman-operator directory to update the bundle version.
      This will generate a new `/bpfman-operator/bundle` directory which will ONLY be tracked in the
      `release-x.x` branch not `main`.
- Verify the CI tests pass and merge the PR into `release-x.x`.
- Create a tag using the `HEAD` of the `release-x.x.x` branch. This can be done using the `git` CLI or
  Github's [release][release] page.
- The Release will be automatically created, after that is complete do the following:
    - run `make build-release-yamls` and attach the yamls for the version to the release. These will include:
        - `bpfman-crds-install.yaml`
        - `bpfman-operator-install.yaml`
        - `go-xdp-counter-install.yaml`
        - `go-tc-counter-install.yaml`
        - `go-tracepoint-counter-install.yaml`
        - `go-uprobe-counter-install.yaml`
        - `go-uretprobe-counter-install.yaml`
        - `go-kprobe-counter-install.yaml`
        - `go-app-counter-install.yaml`
        - `go-xdp-counter-install-selinux.yaml`
        - `go-tc-counter-install-selinux.yaml`
        - `go-tracepoint-counter-install-selinux.yaml`
        - `go-uprobe-counter-install-selinux.yaml`
        - `go-uretprobe-counter-install-selinux.yaml`
        - `go-kprobe-counter-install-selinux.yaml`
        - `go-app-counter-install-selinux.yaml`
- Update the [community-operator](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators) and
  [community-operators-prod](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod) repositories with
  the latest bundle manifests. See the following PRs as examples:
    - https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod/pull/2696
    - https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators/pull/2790
