# Quick Start

This section describes how to deploy `bpfman` quickly from pre-built release
artifacts.  Users can either deploy it locally via provided RPMs or in a
kubernetes cluster via the provided container images and install yamls. See [Releases](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases) for the complete set of bpfman releases.

## Deploy Released RPM from COPR Locally

This section describes how to install an RPM built automatically by the
[Packit Service](https://dashboard.packit.dev/projects/github.com/bpfman/bpfman).
The Packit Service builds RPMs for each release.

To install an RPM generated by the Packit Service, the following packages need
to be installed:

`dnf` based OS:

```console
sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
```

Additionally the [bpfman copr repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/ebpf-sig/bpfman/) needs to be enabled:

```console
sudo dnf copr enable @ebpf-sig/bpfman
```

To see information about the latest released version of bpfman simply run

```console
sudo dnf info bpfman

```

Next install, either the latest version with:

```console
sudo dnf install bpfman 
```

Or install an older version with:

```console
sudo dnf install bpfman-<RELEASE_VERSION> 
```

`bpfman` is now installed but not running. To start the `bpfman-rpc` server process:

```console
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable bpfman.socket
sudo systemctl start bpfman.socket
```

Finally you can run one of the sample applications:

```console
sudo bpfman load image --image-url quay.io/bpfd-bytecode/tracepoint:latest tracepoint --tracepoint sched/sched_switch

sudo bpfman list
 Program ID  Name          Type        Load Time                
 1552        enter_openat  tracepoint  2024-05-06T10:50:57-0400 

sudo bpfman unload 1552
```

When ready to uninstall, determine the RPM that is currently loaded:

```console
$ sudo rpm -qa | grep bpfman
bpfman-0.4.2-1.fc39.x86_64
```

To stop bpfman and uninstall the RPM:

```console
sudo systemctl stop bpfman.socket
sudo systemctl disable bpfman.socket

sudo dnf erase -y bpfman-0.4.2-1.fc39.x86_64

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Deploy Released Container Images on Kubernetes

The quickest solution for running `bpfman` in a Kubernetes deployment is to run a
[local Kubernetes KIND Cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/):

!!! Note 
    OpenShift has tighter security requirements and requires additional
    settings. When deploying bpfman on OpenShift, use the `OperatorHub` from the
    OpenShift console, search for `ebpf`, and install either the `Bpfman
    Operator by Community` or the `eBPF Manager Operator by Red Hat`. The
    `Bpfman Operator by Community` tracks the upstream releases of bpfman. The
    `eBPF Manager Operator by Red Hat` is based on bpfman at the time of the
    corresponding OpenShift release.

```console
kind create cluster --name=test-bpfman
```

Next, deploy the bpfman CRDs:

```console
export BPFMAN_REL=0.5.4
kubectl apply -f  https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v${BPFMAN_REL}/bpfman-crds-install.yaml
```

Next, deploy the `bpfman-operator`, which will also deploy the `bpfman-daemon`, which contains
`bpfman-rpc`, `bpfman` Library and `bpfman-agent`:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v${BPFMAN_REL}/bpfman-operator-install.yaml
```

Finally, deploy an example eBPF program:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v${BPFMAN_REL}/go-xdp-counter-install.yaml

kubectl get xdpprograms
NAME                     BPFFUNCTIONNAME   NODESELECTOR   STATUS
go-xdp-counter-example   xdp_stats         {}             ReconcileSuccess
```

There are other example program install yamls in the artifacts for each
[Release](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases) payload.

Use the following command to teardown the cluster:

```console
kind delete cluster -n test-bpfman
```
