# Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Local Host

This section describes running bpfman and the example eBPF programs on a local host.

## Example Overview

Assume the following command is run:

```console
cd bpfman/examples/go-xdp-counter/
go run -exec sudo . -iface eno3
```

The diagram below shows `go-xdp-counter` example, but the other examples operate in
a similar fashion.

![go-xdp-counter On Host](../img/gocounter-on-host.png)

Following the diagram (Purple numbers):

1. When `go-xdp-counter` userspace is started, it will send a gRPC request over unix
   socket to `bpfman-rpc` requesting `bpfman` to load and attach the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF bytecode
   located on disk at `bpfman/examples/go-xdp-counter/bpf_x86_bpfel.o` at a priority of 50 and on
   interface `eno3`.
   These values are configurable as we will see later, but for now we will use the defaults
   (except interface, which is required to be entered).
2. `bpfman` will load it's `dispatcher` eBPF program, which links to the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF program
   and return a kernel Program ID referencing the running program.
3. `bpfman list programs` can be used to show that the eBPF program was loaded.
4. Once the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF bytecode is loaded and attached, the eBPF program will write packet counts
   and byte counts to a shared map.
5. `go-xdp-counter` userspace program periodically reads counters from the shared map and logs
   the value.

Below are the steps to run the example program described above and then some additional examples
that use the `bpfman` CLI to load and unload other eBPF programs.
See [Launching bpfman](../getting-started/launching-bpfman.md) for more detailed instructions on
building and loading bpfman.
This tutorial assumes bpfman has been built, `bpfman-rpc` is running, and the `bpfman` CLI is in $PATH.

## Running Example Programs

[Example eBPF Programs](./example-bpf.md) describes how the example programs work,
how to build them, and how to run the different examples.
[Build](./example-bpf.md/#building-locally) the `go-xdp-counter` program before continuing.

To run the `go-xdp-counter` program, determine the host interface to attach the eBPF
program to and then start the go program.
In this example, `eno3` will be used, as shown in the diagram at the top of the page.
The output should show the count and total bytes of packets as they pass through the
interface as shown below:

```console
cd bpfman/examples/go-xdp-counter/

go run -exec sudo . --iface eno3
2023/07/17 17:43:58 Using Input: Interface=eno3 Priority=50 Source=/home/$USER/src/bpfman/examples/go-xdp-counter/bpf_x86_bpfel.o
2023/07/17 17:43:58 Program registered with id 6211
2023/07/17 17:44:01 4 packets received

2023/07/17 17:44:07 8 packets received
2023/07/17 17:44:07 1160 bytes received

:
```

In another terminal, use the CLI to show the `go-xdp-counter` eBPF bytecode was loaded.

```console
sudo bpfman list programs
 Program ID  Application    Type        Function Name    Links
 64063                      xdp         xdp_stats        (1) 930390918
```

Finally, press `<CTRL>+c` when finished with `go-xdp-counter`.

```console
:

2023/07/17 17:44:34 28 packets received
2023/07/17 17:44:34 4060 bytes received

^C2023/07/17 17:44:35 Exiting...
2023/07/17 17:44:35 Unloading Program: 6211
```

## Using CLI to Manage eBPF Programs

bpfman provides a CLI to interact with the `bpfman` Library.
Find a deeper dive into CLI syntax in [CLI Guide](./cli-guide.md).
We will load  and attach the simple `xdp-pass` program, which allows all traffic to pass through the attached
interface, `eno3` in this example.
The source code,
[xdp_pass.bpf.c](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/blob/main/tests/integration-test/bpf/xdp_pass.bpf.c),
is located in the [integration-test](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/tree/main/tests/integration-test)
directory and there is also a prebuilt image:
[quay.io/bpfman-bytecode/xdp_pass:latest](https://quay.io/bpfman-bytecode/).

```console
sudo bpfman load image --image-url quay.io/bpfman-bytecode/xdp_pass:latest \
     --programs xdp:pass --application XdpPassProgram

`bpfman load image` returns the same data as the `bpfman get program` command.
From the output, the Program Id of `63661` can be found in the `Kernel State` section.
The Program Id can be used to perform a `bpfman get program` to retrieve all relevant program
data and a `bpfman unload` when the program needs to be unloaded.

```console
sudo bpfman list programs --application XdpPassProgram
 Program ID  Application     Type  Function Name  Links
 63661       XdpPassProgram  xdp   pass
```

We can recheck the details about the loaded program with the `bpfman get program` command:

```console
sudo bpfman get 63661

```

At this point, the program is loaded in kernel memory, but has not been
attached to any hook points.
So the eBPF program will not be triggered.
To attach the eBPF program to a hook point, use the `bpfman attach` command.

```console
sudo bpfman attach 63661 xdp --iface eno3 --priority 35
 Bpfman State
---------------
 BPF Function:       pass
 Program Type:       xdp
 Program ID:         63661
 Link ID:            1301256968
 Interface:          eno4
 Priority:           35
 Position:           0
 Proceed On:         pass, dispatcher_return
 Network Namespace:  None
 Metadata:           bpfman_application=XdpPassProgram
```

`bpfman attach` returns the same data as the `bpfman get link` command.
From the output, the Link Id of `1301256968` can be found in the `Bpfman State` section.
The Link Id can be used to perform a `bpfman get link` to retrieve all relevant link
data.

```console
sudo bpfman list programs --application XdpPassProgram
 Program ID  Application     Type  Function Name  Links
 63661       XdpPassProgram  xdp   pass           (1) 1301256968
```

We can recheck the details about the attached program with the `bpfman get link` command:

```console
sudo bpfman get link 63661 1301256968
 Bpfman State
---------------
 BPF Function:       pass
 Program Type:       xdp
 Program ID:         63661
 Link ID:            1301256968
 Interface:          eno4
 Priority:           35
 Position:           0
 Proceed On:         pass, dispatcher_return
 Network Namespace:  None
 Metadata:           bpfman_application=XdpPassProgram
```

Then unload the program:

```console
sudo bpfman unload 63661
```
