# Run bpfman From Release Image

This section describes how to deploy `bpfman` from a given release.
See [Releases](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases) for the set of bpfman
releases.

!!! Note
    Instructions for interacting with bpfman change from release to release, so reference
    release specific documentation. For example:
    
    [https://bpfman.io/v0.5.4/getting-started/running-release/](https://bpfman.io/v0.5.4/getting-started/running-release/)

Jump to the [Setup and Building bpfman](./building-bpfman.md) section
for help building from the latest code or building from a release branch.

[Start bpfman-rpc](./launching-bpfman.md/#start-bpfman-rpc) contains more details on the different
modes to run `bpfman` in on the host.
Use [Run using an rpm](./running-rpm.md)
for deploying a released version of `bpfman` from an rpm as a systemd service and then use
[Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Local Host](./example-bpf-local.md)
for further information on how to test and interact with `bpfman`.

[Deploying the bpfman-operator](../developer-guide/operator-quick-start.md) contains
more details on deploying `bpfman` in a Kubernetes deployment and
[Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Kubernetes](./example-bpf-k8s.md) contains
more details on interacting with `bpfman` running in a Kubernetes deployment.
Use [Deploying Release Version of the bpfman-operator](#deploying-release-version-of-the-bpfman-operator)
below for deploying released version of `bpfman` in Kubernetes and then use the
links above for further information on how to test and interact with `bpfman`.

## Run as a Long Lived Process

```console
export BPFMAN_REL=0.5.4
mkdir -p $HOME/src/bpfman-${BPFMAN_REL}/; cd $HOME/src/bpfman-${BPFMAN_REL}/
wget https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v${BPFMAN_REL}/bpfman-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzvf bpfman-linux-x86_64.tar.gz; rm bpfman-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

$ tree
.
├── bpf-log-exporter
├── bpfman
├── bpfman-ns
├── bpfman-rpc
└── bpf-metrics-exporter
```

To deploy `bpfman-rpc`:

```console
sudo RUST_LOG=info ./bpfman-rpc --timeout=0
[INFO  bpfman::utils] Has CAP_BPF: true
[INFO  bpfman::utils] Has CAP_SYS_ADMIN: true
[INFO  bpfman_rpc::serve] Using no inactivity timer
[INFO  bpfman_rpc::serve] Using default Unix socket
[INFO  bpfman_rpc::serve] Listening on /run/bpfman-sock/bpfman.sock
:
```

To use the CLI:

```console
sudo ./bpfman list
 Program ID  Name  Type  Load Time
```

Continue in [Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Local Host](./example-bpf-local.md) if desired.

## Deploying Release Version of the bpfman-operator

The quickest solution for running `bpfman` in a Kubernetes deployment is to run a
Kubernetes KIND Cluster:

```console
kind create cluster --name=test-bpfman
```

Next, deploy the bpfman CRDs:

```console
export BPFMAN_REL=0.5.4
kubectl apply -f  https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v${BPFMAN_REL}/bpfman-crds-install.yaml
```

Next, deploy the `bpfman-operator`, which will also deploy the `bpfman-daemon`, which contains
`bpfman-rpc`, `bpfman` Library and `bpfman-agent`:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v${BPFMAN_REL}/bpfman-operator-install-v${BPFMAN_REL}.yaml
```

Finally, deploy an example eBPF program.

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases/download/v${BPFMAN_REL}/go-xdp-counter-install-v${BPFMAN_REL}.yaml
```

There are other example programs in the [Releases](https://github.com/bpfman/bpfman/releases)
page.

Continue in [Deploying the bpfman-operator](../developer-guide/operator-quick-start.md) or
[Deploying Example eBPF Programs On Kubernetes](./example-bpf-k8s.md) if desired.
Keep in mind that prior to v0.4.0, `bpfman` was released as `bpfd`.
So follow the release specific documentation.

Use the following command to teardown the cluster:

```console
kind delete cluster -n test-bpfman
```
